Trigger a GitHub action by clicking a Flic button

# What is a Flic button?
Imagine a button that can control your smartphone or application. A button that you could use to take control of your apps without having to fumble with your phone every time you want to do something.

Wait, what?

Well think about it. We use our smartphones on a daily basis to do a bunch of things. We make phone calls, send texts and emails, we set our alarms, we update our calendars, we play music and some of us even use it to control our smart home devices like our lights and stereos. These things become time consuming, so imagine you could do these things with a little button. 

In this example, we will be using the click of Flic button as a trigger for our GitHub Actions workflow. This could be used for anything from firing off a text to your manager when you need help, triggering a call to your phone to help you escape a bad date, really ANYTHING!
